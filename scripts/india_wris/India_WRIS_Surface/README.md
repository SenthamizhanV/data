## Surface Water Quality Dataset - India WRIS

Water Resources Information System (WRIS): Surface Water Quality dataset includes chemical, physical, and biological properties and can be tested or monitored based on the desired water parameters of concern. Parameters that are frequently sampled or monitored for water quality include temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, ORP, and turbidity.

The quality parameters represented in this dataset are:

- Aluminium (Al)
- Arsenic (As)
- cyanides (CN)
- Carbonate (CO3)
- Calcium (Ca)
- Chloride (Cl)
- Fluorine (F)
- Iron (Fe)
- Hydrogencarbonate (HCO3)
- Mercury (Hg)
- Potassium (K)
- Magnesium (Mg)
- ammonia (NH3)
- Nitrate (NO3)
- Lead (Pb)
- Silver (Ag)
- Sulfate (SO4)
- Silicon dioxide (SiO2)
- Zinc (Zn)
- Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Electrical Conductivity
- Total Hardness
- Total Alkalinity
- Residual Sodium Carbonate
- Sodium absorption ratio (SAR)
- Total Dissolved Solids
- Potential of Hydrogen (pH)

Node properties can be found in the [mcf](./India_WRIS_Surface.mcf) and [tmcf](./India_WRIS_Surface.tmcf) files.
